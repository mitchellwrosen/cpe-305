// GetEventQueue(int size) -- Return singleton EventQueue, creating it with the
// specified initial size if needed.
//
// AddEvent(Event *e) -- Add event e to the queue, ordered by its time.
//
// GetTime() -- Return time of most recently dequeued Event.
//
// Advance() -- Remove next Event from the queue, and Execute it, if there
// are any Events.  Return true iff there was an Event to Execute.
//
// Clear() -- Eliminate all Events from the queue.  (Used in general to end
// the simulation when needed.
//
// Constructor and destructor are private.
